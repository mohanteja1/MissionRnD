You are given a board of N rows and M cols. Each cell in the board contains either 0,1 or 2.
Imagine that you are playing a game called where if you press a button all nearby 1s for every cell
containing 2, will also be changed as 2.
ie If a cell contains 2, after you press the button,  all neighbouring cells in 4 directions, which
has 1 as its value will be changed to 2.

Now if you press the button again, the 1s which are changed to 2 just now, can change their nearby
cells who are 1 to 2 now. Whenever all 1s that can be turned to 2 are turned into 2, the game finishes

Example : 2 Row 5 Cols.
2 1 1 0 1 -> Button Press1 -> 2 2 1 0 1 -> Button Press2 -> 2 2 2 0 1
1 1 0 0 1                     2 1 0 0 1                     2 2 0 0 1

In the above example , the last col 1s cant be changed to 2 as they are never connected to any 2.

Now that you are given a very large board, its taking you hundreds of presses to convert all 1s to 2s.
As you are very impatient, you wanted to write a program which will help you easily to know
how many times you need to press the button to win that game. ?
Ie All 1s that can be convertible to 2 are converted.

Can you help yourself by solving this game? You need to return the number of minimum
button presses required to win the game.

**If at the end of the game, if the board has any uncoverted 1s you need to return -1. ***

Explanation 2 :
2,1,0,0
1,1,1,0
0,0,0,0
2,1,1,0
After pressing button once
2,2,0,0
2,1,1,0
0,0,0,0
2,2,1,0
After pressing button once more (count = 2)
2,2,0,0
2,2,1,0
0,0,0,0
2,2,2,0
After pressing button once more (count = 3)
2,2,0,0
2,2,2,0
0,0,0,0
2,2,2,0
All 1s are converted, So 3 is the answer.

Constraints :
1<N,M<1000.
All values of array will surely be either 0,1 or 2.
