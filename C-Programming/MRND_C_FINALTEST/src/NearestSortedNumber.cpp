	problemCode : NearestSortedNumber
	score : 15

	A Sorted Number is a number in which all its digits are in non-decending order.
	for example "129" , "222", "345", "999" are all Sorted Numbers.
	Where as the numbers "110" , "1000", "143" are not Sorted Numbers.

	You are given an integer N in the form of a string.
	
	Your task is to find the the last Sorted Number in the range [1,N]

	Sorted Numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,  11,12,13,...19,  22,23,24,.... INF]

	Sample Cases : 
	N = 10, result = 9
	N = 12, result = 12
	N = 19, result = 19
	N = 21, result = 19

	Note : 
	1) if there is no answer or the input is invalid , return NULL
	2) Input consists of no leading zeros, and output should not consist of leading zeros
	returning "0002" instead of "2" is considered as a wrong answer.

	Constraints : 
	1 <= len <= 100000 (i.e 100000 digits not integer 100000)
